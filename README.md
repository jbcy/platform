# JBCY Platform
### Some notes

> * The folder was creating as what we had discussed before
> * **dao** is a package for database modification (we need an interface of an entity/model and then an implement of it)
> * **model** is a package for entities and domain
> * **service** is a package for supporting database modification (if you remember the MVVM architecture, the class in this package is a bit like view-model)
> * **servlet** is a package for controlling the behaviour of web (a bit like control in MVC architecture)
> * **utils** is a package for common method (I change its name from "common" to "utils")

***If you have any question or get confused, please text me in whatsapp***

*Have a nice day, Claudia*   
*Best, Jingbo*
